                  Tonle Bati (Khmer: ទន្លេបាទី) is a small lake about 30 km
                  south of Phnom Penh, the capital of Cambodia. It is a popular
                  weekend destination for the local population. It is also a
                  popular fishing spot for both tourists and people who live
                  locally. Close to the lake, there is the Ta Prohm of Bati, one
                  of several shelters built in Cambodia and Thailand during the
                  reign of Jayavarman VII to house the Jayabuddhamahanatha
                  statues.[1]: 175–176  It is located off the highway to Takéo
                  Province. The word Jayabuddhamahanatha means
                  "Victory-Buddha-Great Saviour" and may refer to the defeat of
                  the Chams by the king Jayavarman VII.[2][3] A similar
                  sculpture was found at the Vihar Prampil Lvengo on the Avenue
                  of Victory at Angkor Thom.[4] 20 minutes south of the lake
                  there is another temple called Phnom Chisor (Khmer:
                  ភ្នំជីសូរ). It is situated on a mountain top which requires a
                  visitor to climb 461 steps.
